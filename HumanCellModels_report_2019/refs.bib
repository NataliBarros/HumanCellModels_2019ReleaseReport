Clearly, only pairs of neurons with closely positioned axonal and dendritic branches can be synaptically coupled. For excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex, such axo-dendritic oppositions, termed potential synapses, must be bridged by dendritic spines to form synaptic connections. To explore the rules by which synaptic connections are formed within the constraints imposed by neuron morphology, we compared the distributions of the numbers of actual and potential synapses between pre- and postsynaptic neurons forming different laminar projections in rat barrel cortex. Quantitative comparison explicitly ruled out the hypothesis that individual synapses between neurons are formed independently of each other. Instead, the data are consistent with a cooperative scheme of synapse formation where multiple-synaptic connections between neurons are stabilized while neurons that do not establish a critical number of synapses are not likely to remain synaptically coupled.},

	abstract = {Synaptically coupled layer 2/3 {(L2/3)} pyramidal neurones located above the same layer 4 barrel (‘barrel-related’) were investigated using dual whole-cell voltage recordings in acute slices of rat somatosensory cortex. Recordings were followed by reconstructions of biocytin-filled neurones. The onset latency of unitary {EPSPs} was 1.1 ± 0.4 ms, the 20–80\% rise time was 0.7 ± 0.2 ms, the average amplitude was 1.0 ± 0.7 {mV} and the decay time constant was 15.7 ± 4.5 ms. The coefficient of variation (c.v.) of unitary {EPSP} amplitudes decreased with increasing {EPSP} peak and was 0.33 ± 0.18. Bursts of {APs} in the presynaptic pyramidal cell resulted in {EPSPs} that, over a wide range of frequencies (5–100 Hz), displayed amplitude depression. Anatomically the barrel-related pyramidal cells in the lower half of layer 2/3 have a long apical dendrite with a small terminal tuft, while pyramidal cells in the upper half of layer 2/3 have shorter and often more ‘irregularly’ shaped apical dendrites that branch profusely in layer 1. The number of putative excitatory synaptic contacts established by the axonal collaterals of a L2/3 pyramidal cell with a postsynaptic pyramidal cell in the same column varied between 2 and 4, with an average of 2.8 ± 0.7 (n= 8 pairs). Synaptic contacts were established predominantly on the basal dendrites at a mean geometric distance of 91 ± 47 μm from the pyramidal cell soma. {L2/3-to-L2/3} connections formed a blob-like innervation domain containing 2.8 mm of the presynaptic axon collaterals with a bouton density of 0.3 boutons per μm axon. Within the supragranular layers of its home column a single L2/3 pyramidal cell established about 900 boutons suggesting that 270 pyramidal cells in layer 2/3 are innervated by an individual pyramidal cell. In turn, a single pyramidal cell received synaptic inputs from 270 other L2/3 pyramidal cells. The innervation domain of {L2/3-to-L2/3} connections superimposes almost exactly with that of {L4-to-L2/3} connections. This suggests that synchronous feed-forward excitation of L2/3 pyramidal cells arriving from layer 4 could be potentially amplified in layer 2/3 by feedback excitation within a column and then relayed to the neighbouring columns.},

We characterize this contribution quantitatively by estimating the number of different synaptic connectivity patterns attainable without major arbor remodeling. This number depends on the ratio of the synapses on a dendrite to the axons that pass within a spine length of that dendrite. We call this ratio the filling fraction and calculate it from geometrical analysis and anatomical data. The filling fraction is 0.26 in mouse neocortex, 0.22–0.34 in rat hippocampus. In the macaque visual cortex, the filling fraction increases by a factor of 1.6–1.8 from area V1 to areas V2, V4, and 7a. Since the filling fraction is much smaller than 1, spine remodeling can make a large contribution to structural plasticity.},

	abstract = {Time invariant description of synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits may be precluded by the ongoing growth and retraction of dendritic spines accompanied by the formation and elimination of synapses. On the other hand, the spatial arrangement of axonal and dendritic branches appears stable. This suggests that an invariant description of connectivity can be cast in terms of potential synapses, which are locations in the neuropil where an axon branch of one neuron is proximal to a dendritic branch of another neuron. In this paper, we attempt to reconstruct the potential connectivity in local cortical circuits of the cat primary visual cortex {(V1).} Based on multiple single-neuron reconstructions of axonal and dendritic arbors in 3 dimensions, we evaluate the expected number of potential synapses and the probability of potential connectivity among excitatory (pyramidal and spiny stellate) neurons and inhibitory basket cells. The results provide a quantitative description of structural organization of local cortical circuits. For excitatory neurons from different cortical layers, we compute local domains, which contain their potentially pre- and postsynaptic excitatory partners. These domains have columnar shapes with laminar specific radii and are roughly of the size of the ocular dominance column. Therefore, connections between most excitatory neurons in the ocular dominance column can be implemented by local synaptogenesis. Structural connectivity involving inhibitory basket cells is generally weaker than excitatory connectivity. Here, only nearby neurons are capable of establishing more than one potential synapse, implying that within the ocular dominance column these connections have more limited potential for circuit remodeling.},

Local microcircuits within neocortical columns form key determinants of sensory processing. Here, we investigate the excitatory synaptic neuronal network of an anatomically defined cortical column, the C2 barrel column of mouse primary somatosensory cortex. This cortical column is known to process tactile information related to the C2 whisker. Through multiple simultaneous whole-cell recordings, we quantify connectivity maps between individual excitatory neurons located across all cortical layers of the C2 barrel column. Synaptic connectivity depended strongly upon somatic laminar location of both presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, providing definitive evidence for layer-specific signaling pathways. The strongest excitatory influence upon the cortical column was provided by presynaptic layer 4 neurons. In all layers we found rare large-amplitude synaptic connections, which are likely to contribute strongly to reliable information processing. Our data set provides the first functional description of the excitatory synaptic wiring diagram of a physiologically relevant and anatomically well-defined cortical column at single-cell resolution.},

	abstract = {A highly diverse population of neocortical {GABAergic} inhibitory interneurons has been implicated in multiple functions in information processing within cortical circuits. The diversity of cortical interneurons is determined during development and primarily depends on their embryonic origins either from the medial {(MGE)} or the caudal {(CGE)} ganglionic eminences. Although {MGE-derived} parvalbumin {(PV)-} or somatostatin {(SST)-expressing} interneurons are well characterized, less is known about the other types of cortical {GABAergic} interneurons, especially those of {CGE} lineage, because of the lack of specific neuronal markers for these interneuron subtypes. Using a bacterial artificial chromosome transgenic mouse line, we show that, in the somatosensory cortex of the mouse, the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine {3A} {(5-HT3A)} receptor, the only ionotropic serotonergic receptor, is expressed in most, if not all, neocortical {GABAergic} interneurons that do not express {PV} or {SST.} Genetic fate mapping and neurochemical profile demonstrate that {5-HT3AR-expressing} neurons include the entire spectrum of {CGE-derived} interneurons. We report that, in addition to serotonergic responsiveness via {5-HT3ARs}, acetylcholine also depolarizes {5-HT3AR-expressing} neurons via nicotinic receptors. {5-HT3AR-expressing} neurons in thalamocortical {(TC)} recipient areas receive weak but direct monosynaptic inputs from the thalamus. {TC} input depolarizes a subset of {TC-recipient} {5-HT3AR} neurons as strongly as fast-spiking cells, in part because of their high input resistance. Hence, fast modulation of serotonergic and cholinergic transmission may influence cortical activity through an enhancement of {GABAergic} synaptic transmission from {5-HT3AR-expressing} neurons during sensory process depending on different behavioral states.},

	abstract = {This is the second article in a series of three studies that investigate the anatomical determinants of thalamocortical {(TC)} input to excitatory neurons in a cortical column of rat primary somatosensory cortex {(S1).} Here, we report the number and distribution of {NeuN-positive} neurons within the C2, D2, and D3 {TC} projection columns in P27 rat somatosensory barrel cortex based on an exhaustive identification of 89 834 somata in a 1.15 mm3 volume of cortex. A single column contained 19 109 ± 444 neurons (17 560 ± 399 when normalized to a standard-size projection column). Neuron density differences along the vertical column axis delineated “cytoarchitectonic” layers. The resulting neuron numbers per layer in the average column were 63 ± 10 {(L1)}, 2039 ± 524 {(L2)}, 3735 ± 905 {(L3)}, 4447 ± 439 {(L4)}, 1737 ± 251 {(L5A)}, 2235 ± 99 {(L5B)}, 3786 ± 168 {(L6A)}, and 1066 ± 170 {(L6B).} These data were then used to derive the layer-specific action potential {(AP)} output of a projection column. The estimates confirmed previous reports suggesting that the ensembles of spiny L4 and thick-tufted pyramidal neurons emit the major fraction of {APs} of a column. The number of {APs} evoked in a column by a sensory stimulus (principal whisker deflection) was estimated as 4441 within 100 ms post-stimulus.},

Several groups of GABAergic non-pyramidal cells were identified: (i) parvalbumin fast-spiking (FS) cells with low input resistances and spikes of short duration, including extended plexus (basket) cells and chandelier cells. These cells showed abrupt episodes of non-adapting repetitive discharges; (ii) late-spiking (LS) cells exhibiting slowly developing ramp depolarizations, including neurogliaform cells; (iii) the remaining groups contained both burst-spiking (BS) or regular-spiking (RS) non-pyramidal (NP) cells. BSNP cells exhibited bursting activity (two or more spikes on slow depolarizing humps) from hyperpolarized potentials. Both these physiological types corresponded to a range of morphologies: (i) somatostatin-containing Martinotti cells with ascending axonal arbors to layer I (some were also positive for calbindin D28k); (ii) VIP-containing double bouquet cells with descending axonal arbors as well as arcade cells (these included small cells immunoreactive for CCK or calretinin). Each subtype of cells made GABAergic synapses onto relatively specific portions of cortical cells, but similar domains were innervated by multiple classes of GABA cells.},

abstract ={The physiological and molecular features of nonpyramidal cells were investigated in acute slices of sensory-motor cortex using whole-cell recordings combined with single-cell RT-PCR to detect simultaneously the mRNAs of three calcium binding proteins (calbindin D28k, parvalbumin, and calretinin) and four neuropeptides (neuropeptide Y, vasoactive intestinal polypeptide, somatostatin, and cholecystokinin). In the 97 neurons analyzed, all expressed mRNAs of at least one calcium binding protein, and the majority (n = 73) contained mRNAs of at least one neuropeptide. Three groups of nonpyramidal cells were defined according to their firing pattern. (1) Fast spiking cells (n = 34) displayed tonic discharges of fast action potentials with no accommodation. They expressed parvalbumin (n = 30) and/or calbindin (n = 19) mRNAs, and half of them also contained transcripts of at least one of the four neuropeptides. (2) Regular spiking nonpyramidal cells (n = 48) displayed a firing behavior characterized by a marked accommodation and presented a large diversity of expression patterns of the seven biochemical markers. (3) Finally, a small population of vertically oriented bipolar cells, termed irregular spiking cells (n = 15), fired bursts of action potentials at an irregular frequency. They consistently co-expressed calretinin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. Additional investigations of these cells showed that they also co-expressed glutamic acid decarboxylase and choline acetyl transferase. Our results indicate that neocortical nonpyramidal neurons display a large diversity in their firing properties and biochemical patterns of co-expression and that both characteristics could be correlated to define discrete subpopulations.},
